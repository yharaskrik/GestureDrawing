ColorDetection using Unity 3D

Will detect 3 different gestures. 

Swiping (Target Color 1) Detects left and right movement strictly based on X coordinates

Pinching (Target color 1 and 2) When the centers of mass of both colors move towards or away from each other this is a pinching motion. In the video the same shapes as the next gesture are used for shortness of video

Picture Frame (Target color 1 and 2) because this gesture uses the same colors as pinching both actions are accounted for at the same time. IN the video the console output shows that the frame is shown (with minimal amount of moving) then the objects are moved to show pinching
