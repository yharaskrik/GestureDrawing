Paint Brush app using target colors and hand gestures using Unity 3D

Three targets: 1, 2 and 3

Target 1 is the paintbrush and will draw (using black)
Target 2 needs to be shown to have the paintbrush active but if removed clears the screen and sets to all white.
Target 3 also needs to be visible to be able to draw but if removed it "pauses" the painbrush so the paint brush can be moved somewhere else to draw

NOTE: TextureFilter.cs, TextureScale.cs and the boilerplate of Webcam.cs were supplied. Logic surrounding detecting gestures and drawing using the paintbrush is my own.
