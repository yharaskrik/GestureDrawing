No know bugs
Frame and Pinch use the same colors so they both happen at the same time. I have included the same log output in the FrameLog.txt and PinchLog.txt but can clearly see in the video they both work.

Unity does not provide an easy way to output just what the console shows so the txt files are a tad verbose...
